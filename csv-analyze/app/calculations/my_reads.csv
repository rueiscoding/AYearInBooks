IT DOESNT SOUND LIKE ANYTHING. there’s no feeling. i really have to use my imagination to enhance his vision and try not to fall asleep because he is giving us the bare bones. this gets really tiring since every chapter extensively describes a car or the layout of a room which is already superfluous given that most of these chapters are LESS THAN FIVE PAGES LONG. i can see this working for other people, but i need the prose to be livelier. this is a story of a small town and hopeful people trying to make the best of what they can, but the writing is not doing anything to create this atmosphere. (imo. sorry Steinbeck stans..)<br/><br/>i dunno if i got used to his style or if i started gaslighting myself, because suddenly i was hooked. i’ll be struggling to keep my eyes open and then the next moment i’m laughing out loud (rare; i’m a very serious person) and then i have to catch myself because oh my gosh this boring old book made me laugh. some parts are so soft and introspective they leave a lump in my throat. and steinbeck is surprisingly snarky when he wants to be. for a book so tiny—and accounting for the first half where i was barely awake, making my sample size even smaller—steinbeck explores a vast range of emotions and human experiences in so little pages.<br/><br/>cannery row reads like a collection of sketches that have yet to be completed. every other chapter could technically be read as a standalone, and in these chapters characters are introduced and never explicitly mentioned again. cuz of this a lot of the characters that interested me are never explored after their one and only chapter. even the main characters are not fleshed out in a way that appeals to me. it was still fun, but i wanted more. for this reason, i give it a solid 3 stars x",,,1,0
